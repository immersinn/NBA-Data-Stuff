+ review code, make sure ESPN scrape still works ok
+ figure out where you were / what needs to be done
+ get rid of your stupid sand naming conventions, gah

+ migrate needed files over to new git with better name
+ will require developing new SQL stuff with new python package

> analytics is another section that isn't necessairly on GiHub, and spans both python and R most likely..
